Projet description:
The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

The task for the project:
Set up your system by downloading the necessary repository, files, tools and dependencies
Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.
Generate a patch file of the changes you made
Bonus task: Add unit tests in the test script in the repository.
